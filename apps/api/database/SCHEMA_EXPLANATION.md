---

### 9. `audit_logs` - Immutable Audit Trail

**Purpose:** Append-only audit log for compliance and traceability. **IMMUTABLE** - no updates or deletes allowed.

**Key Features:**
- **Immutable by design** - triggers prevent UPDATE/DELETE
- Event categorization
- Actor information (user, role at time of event)
- Resource information
- Request context (IP, user agent, request ID, session ID)
- Outcome tracking (success/failure)
- Compliance flags (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)

## Design Principles

### 1. UUIDs Everywhere
- All primary keys use UUIDs
- Better for distributed systems
- No sequential ID exposure
- Easier data merging

### 2. Soft Deletes
- All main tables support soft deletes
- `deleted_at` timestamp
- `deleted_by` user reference
- Preserves data for compliance

### 3. Audit Trail
- `created_by` and `updated_by` on all mutable tables
- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Complete change history

### 4. Immutable Audit Logs
- Triggers prevent modification
- Append-only design
- Historical accuracy guaranteed
- Compliance-ready

### 5. Flexible Metadata
- JSONB fields for extensibility
- No schema changes for new fields
- GIN indexes for efficient querying

### 6. Compliance Ready
- Terms and privacy policy tracking
- Retention policy support
- Confidentiality levels
- Compliance flags in audit logs

### 7. No Premature Optimization
- Indexes only where needed
- Views for common queries
- Efficient but not over-optimized

## Views

### `user_active_permissions`
Combines permissions from roles and direct grants, showing only active permissions.

### `process_summary`
Process overview with participant counts for reporting.

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Schema includes commented RLS setup
   - Enable for multi-tenancy if needed

2. **Immutability**
   - Audit logs protected by triggers
   - Cannot be modified or deleted

3. **Soft Deletes**
   - Data preserved for compliance
   - Can be restored if needed

4. **Expiration Management**
   - Roles and permissions can expire
   - Automatic filtering in views

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes**
   - Strategic indexes on foreign keys
   - Composite indexes for common queries
   - GIN indexes for JSONB and arrays

2. **Partitioning** (Future)
   - Audit logs can be partitioned by date
   - Processes can be partitioned by type

3. **Archiving** (Future)
   - Old audit logs can be archived
   - Retention policies can be automated

## Compliance Features

1. **GDPR**
   - User data tracking
   - Right to deletion (soft delete)
   - Audit trail of all access

2. **HIPAA**
   - Access logging
   - Confidentiality levels
   - Audit trail requirements

3. **SOX**
   - Financial data tracking
   - Change audit trail
   - Access controls

4. **General**
   - Immutable audit logs
   - Complete traceability
   - Retention policy support
